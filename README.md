# Sort-File
note when running sort file if you  enter a file name that you wish for it to write
the sorted file into it will remove the old file. So for example
if i want it to sort 'unsorted_file.txt' and I wanna write to a file 
called 'sorted_file.txt' if sorted file does not exist it will create a file for you
however if it already exists it will delete the previous 'sorted_file.txt'
