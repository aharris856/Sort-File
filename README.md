# Sort-File
Create a new file that is a sorted version of the entered file.
Has error reporting for certain things that is useful in larger file sorts if you're using a text editor + command prompt.
I left the error reporting and progress tracking in even while running in Eclipse/IDEs and had no errors even show yet.
This happened pretty frequently (about 1 word per run but it does correct the error) in the large_unsorted.txt file if I
was using a text editor and running it via the command promt rather than from an IDE. You can always remove error tracking and 
progress tracking if you wanna test it yourself.
